1. Introduction                                                *QFEnter-intro*

QFEnter provides more intuitive file opening methods in vim Quickfix window.

Some of the default methods are quite inconvenient,

- You cannot specify the window in which a file is opened when you press 
`<Enter>` in Quickfix - only the window above Quickfix window. 
It is inconsistent with other Quickfix commands like `:cnext` and `:cprev`
 which open a file in a previously focused window.

- You also cannot specify the window when you use `Ctrl-W <Enter>`, 
because vim always create a new horizontal split window above Quickfix window.
There is even no command for 'open in new vertical split window'.

They are confusing and bothers me every time, so I wrote a simple plugin 
to make up for these weak points.
It's name comes from the most basic method for opening a file in Quickfix window
 - the `<Enter>` key.

2. Usage                                                       *QFEnter-usage*

- `<Enter>`, `<2-LeftMouse>` Open a file under cursor in previously 
  focused window. (`<2-LeftMouse>` means a left mouse button double click.)

- `<Leader><Enter>` Open a file under cursor in new vertical split 
  from previously focused window.

- `<Leader><Space>` Open a file under cursor in new horizontal split 
  from previously focused window.

You can change the key mappings in your .vimrc (see |QFEnter-options|).
